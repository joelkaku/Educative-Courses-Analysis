# Educative-Courses-Analysis
Online learning is the new norm, and there are tons of options out there. 
Educative is a platform designed for developers and software engineers to upskill, master new topics, and prepare for coding interviews.  
Some columns included in the data are course names, prices, number of subscribers, rating, content duration, etc.

### Data Cleaning Steps:
- Duplicate entries and blank rows were removed
- Course ID was converted from integer to text
- Price column was converted to currency
- Headers were properly formatted
- The Subject column was trimmed for consistency
- The Published Date column was split into date and time columns

### Analysis:
- A free/paid column was created to indicate whether a course was paid or not.
- VLOOKUP was used to display a list of the top 20 courses(by subscriber count), their level, duration, published date and whether they were free or paid.
- Pivot tables were used to summarize and analyze the data by subscribers, course costs, duration and rating, revenue generated, etc
- Charts were created to visualize the findings both in Excel and Power BI

### Recommendations:
- Strategic pricing: Educative can consider raising prices for the Web Development course as it has high average revenue and strong demand. The price increase, nevertheless, should not be so vast as to discourage a lot of people from purchasing the courses.  
- Bundle offerings: Seeing that low-code and no-code tools are in-demand, Educative can include lectures and certifications on these tools as part of the Web Development course thereby giving subscribers real value for their monies.
- Content optimization: Educative should consider investing in improving the content and marketing of the other subjects (Graphic Design, Musical Instruments, Business Finance) to attract a wider audience, thereby increasing revenue and consequently, profit margins.
